  <blockquote>    "All is Go." - The words we've all been waiting for.  </blockquote>  <hr />
  <p>This Sunday, on their fourth attempt, NASA officials determined they could send the  Atlas V safely towards the ISS, and finally launched the Atlas V. In itself, the rocket  is not very interesting. It's very aerodynamic, and is a result of many years of  engineering and study, but today, it's not about the Atlas V. It's about it carries,  the Cygnus Orbital 4.</p>
  <p>The Cygnus contains much awaited resources for the astronauts living on the ISS, the  last coming as far away as October, as well as several new research projects to test.  Some of these projects include Astro Pi, NASA's test Hololens devices, a new jetpack  titled 'SAFER', a life science testing system called 'Space Automated Bioproduct Lab'  (SABL), and many others.</p>
  <p>I'm most excited about Astro Pi's launch. The 'Astro Pi' is a project by Raspberry  Pi, endorsing a board primarily just a Raspberry Pi 2 device with a Sense HAT  connected. It was originally supposed to be a B+, but there was so much delay in  release of the project, and there were so little compatibility issues that the folks at  Astro Pi decided to upgrade the system.</p>&nbsp; <img src=  "https://www.raspberrypi.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/astro-pi-hat.png" alt="" width=  "520" />

  <p>A Sense HAT is a $35 GPIO connected development board with an integrated sensor of  gyroscope, accelerometer, magnetometer, separate sensors for temperature and barometric  pressure, humidity, an 8*8 RGB LED matrix, and a 5-key joystick. So, its an interactive  multi-sensor that can draw pictures as programmed. Pretty awesome.</p>
  <p>Astro Pi ran an international programming competition. The goal was for grade-school  children to program what they wanted the Astro Pi project to do at the ISS, and  hopefully learn something in the process. The seven winners created functional and easy  programs to run aboard the ISS, with one sensing crew location [Crew Detector], one  determining what country they were above and showing their flag [Flags], and one  [SpaceCRAFT] even analyzing the data it finds as a <a href=  "http://pi.minecraft.net">Minecraft Pi Edition&reg;</a> map.</p>
  <p>Just imagine it; years from now, when the Astro Pi comes back down, we'll be toying  with subatomic particles on our personal computers, and we'll have to get our old  Minecraft installation out to play a Minecraft game <strong><em>truly inspired by  space</em></strong>. Wow... Why can't that be now?</p><img src=  "http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/images/mars/20150121/mars20150121-16.jpg" alt="" width=  "520" />

  <p>Hololens has also made a name for themselves. This ambitious augumented reality  headset has already made itself a future, whether it be the US's own research  organization's endorsement, or the determination of its parent, Microsoft, in it.</p>
  <p>They are using the Hololens's powerful multi-core processor to analyze data the  rovers they send to Mars discover, and visualize the data for employees and other  scientists in general. It's currently, given its price, on the road to become a  business device, though Microsoft is already paving the path for consumers by porting  some of its major games and apps to Hololens, e.g. Minecraft, and Xbox. I wonder if Tim  peake will use Minecraft Windows 10 Edition Beta on the Hololens to view the SpaceCRAFT  map I was talking about earlier... Sorry, off topic!</p>

  <p>Another exciting news point is a new set of tutorials to get on the blockchain that  has taken the world by storm. Ethereum developer, <a href=  "https://github.com/alexvandesande">Alex Van de Sande</a>, has already begun to review  and introduce Ethereum's GUI wallet, Mist, in its early betas. The reviews tell you  about how to use ether, craft tokens, develop democracies and other contracting  devices, execute functions from bytecode, and even host a bank. These tutorials are  part of an movement for not only private blockchains, but personal and customizable  blockchains. It illustrates how the blockchain can be used for actual business and fun  purposes through common applications. And all of this, in less than an Hour of  Code.</p>
  <p>These reviews are made easy by the (in-development) GUI-based tools: the geth based  <a href="https://github.com/ethereum/mist">Mist browser</a> (to be 1.0 in Metropolis),  and the eth based <a href="https://github.com/ethereum/alethzero">AlethOne</a> (already  out of beta). Also, an eth-based IDE, <a href=  "https://github.com/ethereum/mix">Mix</a>, is already in development if you want to  check it out.</p>
  <p>Anyways, that's about it on Eli's Web Log of Webbiness for today. Sorry about the  HTML frustration, I think I'll be able to make it as the WordPress format this coming  week. But regardless of format, I'll see you next time!</p>  <p><a class="thumbnail self may-blank " href="http://edublogs.eanesisd.net/eli8742022/2015/12/11/atlas-v-is-go-and-ethereum-in-practice/#respond">Comment?</a>  </p>  </div></body></html>
